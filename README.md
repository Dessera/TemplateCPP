# Template for C++ project based on CMake & Conan & Vscode
## Usage
### Conan Profiles
The config directory saves the conan profiles for `clang-16` and `gcc-11` on Ubuntu, which are used to build the project.
You can use your own profiles by executing the following commands:
```shell
conan profile detect --name=xxx
```
### CMake Presets
When you use gcc, you can use presets generated by conan to build the project.
But when you use clang, you need to use presets defined in the CMakeUserPresets.json file to build the project.

(It seems like a platform-dependent issue, It depends on where `c++` links to.)

It's recommended to modify the presets to fit your environment (especially the `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` variable)
### Build
```shell
# generate conan toolchain file
# xxx leads to the name of your conan profile
conan install . -pr=xxx --build=missing
```
Then, select the preset you want to use and build the project.
Do not forget to change the project name in the `CMakeLists.txt` file.
